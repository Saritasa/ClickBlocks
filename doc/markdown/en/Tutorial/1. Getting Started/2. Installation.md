# Installation #

To install the framework is sufficient to perform the following simple steps:
- Download framework's files from the repository [https://github.com/Saritasa/ClickBlocks](https://github.com/Saritasa/ClickBlocks) to the document root of the site.
- Placed at the beginning of your script the following code:
  ```php
  <?php
  
  require_once(__DIR__ . '/connect.php');
  ```

This assumes that your script is in the root of the site in the same place where the file **connect.php** If your script is located in a different directory, you will need to specify the correct path to the file **connect.php**

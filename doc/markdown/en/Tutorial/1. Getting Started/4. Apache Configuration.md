# Apache Configuration #

ClickBlocks is initially ready to work with the default configuration of the web server Apache. In order to limit access to specific resources for an application you can use file **.htaccess** (which is located in the root directory of your web site):

```
RewriteEngine On

# restricts access to the configuration data, cache data and error logs.
RewriteRule ^/?Application/_config/?(.*)$ /controller.php
RewriteRule ^/?Temporary/_cache/?(.*)$ /controller.php
RewriteRule ^/?Temporary/_log/?(.*)$ /controller.php

# if the directory or file exists, then use them directly.
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f

# otherwise redirect to controller.php
RewriteRule . /controller.php  
DirectoryIndex /controller.php
```

If necessary, you can edit this file on your own.

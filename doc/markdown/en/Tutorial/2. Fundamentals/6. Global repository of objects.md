# Global Repository of Objects #

The framework provides access to the global repository of objects in the form of implementation of the design pattern Registry. In this implementation, the objects are stored in a class **CB** in a private static property. Appropriate methods of the class can perform basic operations on objects of registry.
```php
// Adds some object "foo" to the registry.
CB::set('foo', new MyClass());
// Gets object "foo" from the registry.
$foo = CB::get('foo');
// Checks whether object "foo" is in the registry.
if (CB::has('foo'))
{
  // If it is in then removes object "foo" from the registry.
  CB::remove('foo');
}
// Gets an array of all registry objects.
print_r(CB::all());
```
